### Introduction:
In a world filled with academic fraud and credential misrepresentation, ZkDegree stands as a beacon of trust and innovation. Our revolutionary platform leverages Polygon ID, Dock.io, and Circle Payments to securely deliver verifiable academic credentials directly to your PolygonID wallet. No more worries about counterfeit degrees or identity theft—ZkDegree is here to change the game.

### Problem Statement:
In today's society, the prevalence of fraudulent academic degrees, especially in rural areas, poses a significant problem. The ease with which traditional paper degrees can be manipulated and forged leads to a lack of transparency and accountability in educational qualifications.

When individuals apply for jobs, companies face a dilemma: either blindly trust the information provided on resumes or invest time and resources into verifying each candidate's academic background with universities. This inefficiency not only hampers the hiring process but also allows dishonest individuals to thrive.

### Features:
#### 1. Verifiable Credentials for Universities:
ZkDegree empowers universities to create and issue verified digital credentials for their students. With our platform, educational institutions can seamlessly transition from paper-based degrees to secure, blockchain-backed certificates.

#### 2. Secure Identity Verification with Polygon ID:
Students can authenticate their academic credentials using Polygon ID—a pioneering identity solution that employs zero-knowledge proofs. This ensures that only individuals with valid identity credentials from their respective universities can access and claim their digital degrees.

#### 3. Privacy-Preserving Proof Sharing:
Our platform enables students to share only the necessary attributes, such as university name and student name, when providing proof of their academic qualifications. This privacy-centric approach ensures that personal data remains protected while still allowing for verification.

#### 4. Empowering Global Financial Transactions using Circle:
Having your identity and semester degrees on your PolygonID wallet opens up a world of possibilities. Users can securely pay for college fees, mess fees, and more via Circle Payments. Circle offers global payment solutions, including inbound and outbound payments, as well as cryptocurrency and card payment options using USDC.

### How It Works:
ZkDegree operates at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and academic verification. Here's how our platform functions:

1. **University Credential Issuance:** Universities and educational institutions issue verified credentials through our platform, powered by Dock.io Polygon ID credentials.

2. **Student Authentication:** Students authenticate their identity and academic credentials using Polygon ID. This step ensures that only eligible individuals can access and claim their digital degrees.

3. **Secure Proof Delivery:** Once authenticated, students can effortlessly retrieve their degrees as verifiable proofs in their Polygon ID app. These proofs can be used for job applications and other verification purposes.

### Why Polygon ID?
Verifiable credentials meet the Web3 era, bringing real-world data into the blockchain realm. Polygon ID is at the forefront of this revolution by allowing users to use zero-knowledge proofs to interact with smart contracts. It adheres to the "Verifiable Credentials" (VC) and "Decentralized Identifiers" (DID) W3C standards, enhancing interoperability for decentralized applications.

Polygon ID comprises three essential components:
- **Identity Holder:** Students pursuing university courses.
- **Verifier:** Our Dapp, ZkDegree, responsible for credential checks and verification.
- **Issuer:** Universities, institutes, and companies that issue verified credentials to students.

Issuer organizations issue Verifiable Credentials (VCs) through our platform, powered by Dock.io Polygon ID credentials, ensuring the utmost security and trustworthiness.
